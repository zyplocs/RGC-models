# `RGC-models` 👁️‍🗨️

## What?
This is my repository for building and experimenting with elementary models of retinal ganglion cell activation. These models are presently superficial and do not aim to reflect the complexity of the human visual system.

### `model0`
First iteration of RGC simulator. This approach implements a convolution of an input stimuli and a basic cell response while factoring in center-surround characteristics.

### `model1`
Iteration of `model0` with an additional graphing feature.

### `model2`
Under construction model. Details TBA.

## Why?
`RGC-models` is a way to challenge myself and develop programming skills by building basic scripts defining characteristics of the human visual system. These "models" are admittedly simple and are not presently an accurate representation of visual streams.
