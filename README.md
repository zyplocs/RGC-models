# `RGC-models` 👁️‍🗨️

## What?
`RGC-models` is my repository for building and experimenting with elementary models of retinal ganglion cell activation. These models are presently superficial and do not aim to reflect the complexity of the human visual system.

## Why?
`RGC-models` is a way to challenge myself and develop programming skills by building basic scripts definining characteristics of the human visual system.
